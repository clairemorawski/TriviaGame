# TriviaGameBasic

*I have created a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

*The user will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

 *The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that the user answer correctly and incorrectly.

*The user cannot pick more than one answer per question.

*A countdown timer has been included.
